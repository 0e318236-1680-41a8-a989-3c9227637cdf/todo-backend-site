    <h1 class="secondary-title">Creating a new Todo-Backend API implementation</h1>
    <br>
    <p>It's pretty simple to implement the Todo-Backend API. The entire API consists of about 5 distinct operations
        (create a todo, view a todo, modify a todo, list all todos, delete all todos).</p>


    <h1 class="contribute-headers">Drive the implementation out with tests</h1>
    <p>
        The API is defined using a <a href="specs/index.html">series of automated tests</a>. You can point the test
        suite at any url you want, and it will attempt to verify that the url correctly implements the API spec.
        <br><br>
        The tests are intentionally designed in a kata-like structure. Getting the first test to pass is the start of
        your journey implementing the API, and each subsequent test should lead you further towards a fully functioning
        implementation. When all the tests are passing you have a fully compliant Todo-Backend API implementation.
    </p>

    <h1 class="contribute-headers">Enable CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)</h1>

    <p>
      The most common initial gotcha when implementing Todo-Backend is getting CORS headers right. Both the Todo-Backend 
      web client and the Todo-Backend specs themselves will be running javascript from a different domain than the one 
      where your API implementation will live. That means that your API implementation will need to 
      <a href="http://enable-cors.org/server.html">enable CORS support</a> by including a couple of custom HTTP headers 
      and responding to the relevant OPTIONS HTTP requests.
        <br><br>
        The automated spec tests are designed to guide you towards implementing CORS correctly. Additionally, you may

    <h1 class="contribute-headers">Get your implementation listed</h1>

    <p>To have your implementation listed on this site you simple need to have it running somewhere live. 
      <a href="http://heroku.com">Heroku</a> is an free and easy way to host a live instance of your site. Once you have 
      an instance running, just send a GitHub Pull Request to the 
      <a href="https://github.com/TodoBackend/todo-backend-site">Todo-Backend site repo</a> adding information about the 
      implementation to the <a href="https://github.com/TodoBackend/todo-backend-site/blob/master/data/implementations.yaml">list of implementations</a>. GitHub enables you to do the editting and Pull Request creation entirely in the browser if you want - just edit
      <a href="https://github.com/TodoBackend/todo-backend-site/blob/master/data/implementations.yaml">this file.</a></p>
